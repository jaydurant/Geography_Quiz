Description: This directory contains three files which generate the code for my first vanilla javascript project.

The project consists of 3 different files

1. html file which contains the structure of the code
2. javascript file which contains the logic which changes the question, keeps score, and changes the dynamic html on the main index.html file
3.css file which adds font and positions through the html file

This project shows the use of 

- vanilla javascript to interact with the DOM
- use of cookies to track the user's input
- use of localStorage to recored information over multiple user sessions
- css animations and selections to alter element styles
- html structure
- use of flexbox to create a responsive website


Future Improvement:

Removing html in javascript through use of handlebars

Using JSON to store questions and answers

creating a login page for users to create an accoutn through local storage
